- In this paper, we propose a novel evolution strategy for solving many-objective optimization problems, named MaOES.
- The proposed algorithm uses mutation and selection for individual self-adaptation. The Precision Controllable Mutation operator is designed for individuals to explore and exploit the decision space efficiently. The Maximum Extension Distance strategy is tailored to guide the individuals to keep uniform distance among particles in the population and to facilitate the extension to approximate the entire Pareto front automatically.

- In this paper, a novel parameter-less constraint handling technique is proposed, which divides the whole population into three mutually exclusive subsets dynamically, including FNDS, the subset dominated by FNDS, and the subset not dominated by FNDS. According to the proposed division of labor, it is not necessary to balance the convergence and constrained satisfaction in each subset.
- Secondly, to avoid been trapped into local optima, the proposed algorithm adopts a two-stage strategy to solve CMOPs.
- In the first stage, the proposed algorithm focuses solely on converging toward the unconstrained PF without considering the constrained satisfaction.
- In the second stage, the FNDS constraint handling technique is adopted to guide the population converging towards PF effectively.

- In this paper, a novel multi-objective evolution strategy was proposed for solving multitask optimization problems. Inspired by modern cultural evolution theory, elite-guided variation strategy, and horizontal cultural transmission strategy, two evolutionary operators were proposed.
- To make full use of the two transfer strategies, an adaptive information transfer strategy is proposed to adjust the probability of the information transfer adaptively according to the dominant relationship between the offspring and its parent to reasonably allocate the evolutionary resources.

- In this paper, a novel multiobjective multifactorial immune algorithm (MOMFIA) is proposed to solve MOMTO and MOMaTO problems. The proposed MOMFIA applied a novel multipopulation framework and a novel information transfer method based on the dimensional information of solutions (DIS). The proposed multi-population framework can evenly distribute individuals to different subpopulations, each of which maintains an independent task module, can evolve independently, but is also equipped to transfer their knowledge when necessary.

- In this paper, a novel hybrid multi-objective multifactorial memetic algorithm is proposed to solve MOMTO problems. The proposed variable classification method will classify decision variables into convergence-related and diversity-related decision variables. Only the same type of decision variables in the source and target tasks can transfer information to avoid negative transfer. 
- Different evolutionary operators are adopted according to the characteristics of decision variables during individual recombination. 
- In addition, the proposed algorithm hybridizes the immune algorithm as the global evolutionary operator and the evolutionary gradient search algorithm as the local search operator into the multifactorial framework to enhance the searching ability.
